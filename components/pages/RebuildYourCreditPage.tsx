                Start by making sure you make all of your payments on time. This will show lenders
                that you’re reliable and capable of repaying your debts. You should also try to keep
                your balances low. This shows that you’re not overextending yourself financially and
                that you’re able to manage your debts responsibly.

            Last but not least, don’t apply for new credit too often. Every time you apply for
            credit, it results in a hard inquiry on your credit report. This can temporarily lower
            your score. So, if you’re planning on applying for a car loan or another type of credit,
            make sure you do it in a way that won’t hurt your score too much.

                Bad credit can stay on your record for six to seven years. However, the exact length
                of time is also dependent on the credit bureau. Equifax Canada counts from the date
                the debt is first assigned to a collection agency.

                If you have bad credit, it’s important to take steps to improve your credit rating.
                This will help you qualify for better loan terms and interest rates in the future.
                You can improve your credit rating by paying your bills on time, maintaining a good
                credit history, and using a credit monitoring service.

                If you have experienced a drop in your credit score, it is important to take steps
                to rebuild it. A low credit score can impact your ability to obtain new lines of
                credit and loans, and can even lead to higher interest rates.
